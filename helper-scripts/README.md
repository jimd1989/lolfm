# Helper scripts

Some shell scripts that can (ab)use lolfm's features to go beyond cmus scrobbling. Just `chmod +x` them and put them in `/usr/local/bin` or wherever.

## cmus event format

lolfm uses `cmus-remote -Q` under the hood, which spits out events like

```
status paused
file /music/Throwing Muses/The Real Ramona/10 Honeychain.mp3
duration 264
position 1
tag artist Throwing Muses
tag album The Real Ramona
tag title Honeychain
tag date 1991
tag genre Alternative
tag discnumber 01
tag tracknumber 10
tag albumartist Throwing Muses
```

It parses these events into db rows, using `status` as its delimiter. If you wish to mock these events, you should also begin each one with `status playing|paused|stopped`. Songs are written with subsequent events of `playing|paused` and `stopped` are passed through, or if one `playing|paused` event is followed by another `playing|paused` event with different song info.

Running `lolfm dump -e` will also output tweaked versions of this format for db migrations. 

If you think about it, you aren't really wedded to cmus at all for most of lolfm's facilities: only `init` and `event`. You can always use `lolfm read plays` on stdin to ingest arbitrary text in this format.

The program uses some custom rows too.

- `love`: A delimiter representing a loved song. For importing loved tracks.
- `time n`: A Unix timestamp in seconds. For importing loved tracks.
- `timemilliseconds n`: A Unix timestamp in milliseconds. For recording play events.

Feel free to hack on it. If you have another instance of `cmus` running on a different computer, its `status_display_program` could be a shell script that just logs `cmus-remote -Q` with one extra line of `timemilliseconds <time-in-milliseconds>`. You can `cat` this dumb log of events back into your main db at a later date with `lolfm read plays`.

Just be aware of overlapping timestamps causing problems.

## Example: manually recording plays for an existing album

If you like CDs or vinyl, you can `lolfm dump` to record another round of plays for an album that's already in your db. I spun _Steve McQueen_ two days back, but I'll record it now.

You can isolate the tracks of an album with `grep` and `awk`. `lolfm-album-search` does this.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
lolfm dump plays "PATH TO YOUR DB" | grep "$1" | cut -d "	" -f 2- | awk '!seen[$0]++'
```

(You can use a literal tab as a `cut` delimiter by doing ctrl-v + tab. Dunno how common that knowledge is.)

```
$ lolfm-album-search "Steve McQueen"

Prefab Sprout   Appetite        Steve McQueen   1985    Prefab Sprout   Pop     236

Prefab Sprout   When the Angels Steve McQueen   1985    Prefab Sprout   Pop     269
```

Two big assumptions here:

1. You've filtered accordingly. Here "Steve McQueen" is all I need, but this might have to be a fancier. I find that further piping into `grep` and `grep -v` gets everything eventually.
2. Your plays are in the correct track order. This is determined based on when they were first played. You might want to write this to a text file and move around if not.

This output can go into another `awk` that breaks one line into cmus event format. This is `lolfm-to-events`. Its sole argument is a `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` timestamp, which it will count forward from using the `duration` column.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
awk -F '\t' -v sum="$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" "$1" +%s)" '{sum += $7; print "status playing\ntag artist " $1 "\ntag title " $2 "\ntag album " $3 "\ntag date " $4 "\ntag albumartist " $5 "\ntag genre " $6 "\nduration " $7 "\ntimemilliseconds " (sum - 1) * 1000 "\nstatus stopped\ntimemilliseconds " sum * 1000}'
```

This can be read back into the same db with `lolfm read`. The full command is as follows.

```
$ lolfm-album-search "Steve McQueen" | lolfm-to-event "2025-03-03 15:00" | lolfm read plays /path/to/my.db

The vinyl play on March 3rd was successfully recorded into the past, even though other digital plays have taken place afterwards.

### Example: logging a new album

If you think about it, only the tracklist and runtimes of an album are tedious to record. Everything else is a constant value. `discogs-search` calculates these from a Discogs release (not master!) page.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
id="$(echo "$1" | cut -d "/" -f 5 | cut -d "-" -f 1)"
curl https://api.discogs.com/releases/$id --user-agent "jq test" | jq -r '.tracklist[] | select(.type_ == "track") | "\(.title)\t\((.duration | split(":") | .[0] | tonumber) * 60 + (.duration | split(":") | .[1] | tonumber))"'
```

This should work for most releases. Hour+ songs, V/A compilations, etc won't benefit. That's why it's a helper script, not a solution.

```
$ discogs-search https://www.discogs.com/release/11400-Joy-Division-Unknown-Pleasures
Disorder	216
Day Of The Lords	283
Candidate	180
Insight	264
New Dawn Fades	287
She's Lost Control	238
Shadowplay	230
Wilderness	155
Interzone	130
I Remember Nothing	360
```

This can be fed into another `awk` with the constants "artist", "album", "year", and "genre" as arguments. It wasn't worth it to mangle `jq` further to extract any of this. This is available as `discogs-extra-tags`.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
awk -F '\t' -v artist="$1" -v album="$2" -v year="$3" -v genre="$4" '{print artist "\t" $1 "\t" album "\t" year "\t" artist "\t" genre "\t" $2}'
```

Example.

```
$ discogs-search https://www.discogs.com/release/11400-Joy-Division-Unknown-Pleasures | discogs-extra-tags "Joy Division" "Unknown Pleasures" 1979 "Post Punk"
Joy Division	Disorder	Unknown Pleasures	1979	Joy Division	Post Punk	216

```

You can see this is the same format as `lolfm dump` now. Which means it can be piped back into `lolfm-to-events` and `lolfm read`. I usually like to write this bit to a file so I can confirm it's all good.

## Future events

You can feed lolfm events that have yet to transpire. It will save them all, but won't write played songs until the system time has moved beyond the event timestamp. This is (maybe) useful if you want to record a vinyl album right when you put it on, rather than later. I can also see it being a source of headachesâuse it at your discretion. Because lolfm is event driven, you'll have to feed it another event to actually write the events later. It won't automatically record them when the time has arrived.
