# lolfm

Set logger to executable with

```
chmod +x /path/to/lolfm-record-event.scm
```

Then in cmus' `:` menu, enter

```
set status_display_program=/path/to/lolfm-record-event.scm
```

Event sourcing, DB, and analysis forthcoming.

DB schema will be updated through proper migration scripts eventually, but since this isn't even MVP yet, expect breaking changes to schema.
